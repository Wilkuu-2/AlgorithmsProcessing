# Processing algorithms for CreaTe M4

## Goal

The goals of this repo is to share basic and some less basic implementations of programs that simulate physical scenarios.
Each algorithm has it's own folder, because processing likes it that way. 

## Algorithms

* Directory A1 
  * Some char\[\] algorithms 
  * Binary to decimal conversion
  * Summing multiples of numbers
  * Mutually colliding particles using PVectors
  * Mutually non-colliding particles using PVectors
  * More will come shortly

* Directory A2 
  * Coming soon
